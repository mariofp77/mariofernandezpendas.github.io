WORK IN PROGRESS - THIS PAGE WILL BE RELEASED SOON

I am mainly interested in the development of enhanced sampling techniques and numerical methods applied to the field of molecular simulation. I have worked with several techniques that range from Hybrid Monte Carlo methods and numerical integrators to Markov State Models or free energy calculations. I contribute both in the theoretical formulation of the methods and the practical implementation in different software packages aiming at running at high performance computers.

Currently, I am working on the development of machine learning force fields in the group of <a href="https://www.ikerbasque.net/es/ivan-infante">Ivan Infante</a> at the <a href="https://www.bcmaterials.net/en">BCMaterials</a> (Bilbao, Basque Country).
